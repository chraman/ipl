        <p>Max Ogden was developing Recline as the frontend data browser and editor for
        his <a href="http://datacouch.com/">http://datacouch.com/</a> project.
        Meanwhile, Rufus Pollock and the <a href="http://ckan.org/">CKAN team</a> at
        the <a href="http://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> had been working
        on a <a href="http://github.com/okfn/dataexplorer">Data Explorer</a> for use in
        <a href="http://thedatahub.org">the DataHub</a> and <a
          href="http://ckan.org/">CKAN software</a>.</p>
        
        <p>When they met up, they realized that they were pretty much working on the
        same thing and so decided to join forces to produce the new Recline Data
        Explorer.</p>

        <p>The new project forked off <a
          href="https://github.com/maxogden/recline">Max's original recline
          codebase</a> combining some portions of the <a
          href="http://github.com/okfn/dataexplorer">original Data Explorer</a>.
        However, it has been rewritten from the ground up using Backbone.</p>
