# Review of Timeline Software

General comments. Timeline libraries consist of various components:

* Data loading
  * Date parsing
* Band (timeline) rendering
* Showing render info on individual items

For me a timeline visualization library need only be the second of these but most that I've come across do both and more.

In fact a major issue in my opinion with most libraries is that they are *too under-componentized* - they don't separate cleanly into these different components and end up doing everything.

To take one example, the Verite timeline (in my view is one of the best libraries out there) has a whole bunch of its own custom date parsing built in inside an internal utility library which are hard to override or replace and also has a large chunk of code just for loading from google docs and other data sources. (You can of course somewhat solve this somewhat -- as I do in Recline by parsing the dates directly  and then submitting in a standardized form). Even if library authors do want to include these things it would be good to do it in a way that allowed for a clean separation so that you could just use the parts you wanted.


## Propublic Timeline Setter

* HTML + JS
  * But Requires a build step (using ruby)
* Very simple and compact design (nice!)

## Verite Timeline

* Very elegant design
* Includes much more than Timeline (e.g. sourcing data from google docs etc)
* Mozilla Public License (was GPL)

## Simile Timeline

* http://www.simile-widgets.org/timeline/
* The original open-source JS timeline but less regularly update and maintained today: "As of Spring 2012, Exhibit is the only Simile widget seeing active development." and the timeline control has not been updated since 2009 (see this [stackoverflow question for more](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4700419/alternative-to-simile-timeline-for-timeline-visualization)

## Chronoline

* http://stoicloofah.github.com/chronoline.js/
* Recently developed and updated
* MIT licensed

## Timeglider

* <https://github.com/timeglider/jquery_widget>
* Non-open license (but was MIT licensed [earlier on](https://github.com/timeglider/jquery_widget/tree/345442fa3dc7c66b23c36031a6569693ecf309bd)

## CHAPS Timeline

* <http://almende.github.com/chap-links-library/timeline.html>
* Looks pretty nice though CSS is not quite as elegant (probably fixable!)
* Not clear whether it supports multiple bands


# Using Verite Timeline

Some notes on how to use the VeriteCo timeline software based on experience integrating into [Recline Data Explorer][recline].

* Date parsing: it is reasonably particular at the moment re date support and it's default is the rather unusual yyyy,mm,dd format. ISO format yyyy-mm-dd is not supported.
