## Create a Project

As a User I want to **create a Project and associate files to that project (online or local)** so that **I can reload that project later automatically**

A project has:

* ID, title, description, keywords
* Resources
** Data Files
** Data APIs
* Scripts
* Apps/Views

Notes:
* Do we really need multiple files?

## Write scripts

As a User I want to write scripts for a project so that I can re-run those scripts later and thereby recreate the results (e.g. a specific visualization)

## Specify type metadata

As a User I want to create type information about an object

## Export data

As a **User** I want to **export my data to an online service such as the DataHub**

Notes:

* I want my API key to be easily retrieved in a secure way
* I want to have my login details remembered for next time so I don't have to re-add them ...
* I want export to happen reasonably quickly and progress to be shown (bulk export)
* I want upserts to happen when needed when object with that ID already exists
* I want the connection of this data file with a given online store to be remembered so I can easily repeat this upload later

## Share with Others

As a User I want to Share my project with others so that they can see what I have done
