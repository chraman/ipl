Thoughts about how to do viz and "views/apps" in Explorer (and CKAN).

Wants:

US#1 As a **User** I want to **Graph a dataset** so that **I get an overview of what is in it**

  * Qus: what kind of graphs?
  * Is this via a simple configurable interface or should I be able to do rich JS?
    * Rich JS gives full power but also allows for abuse. However, producing a graph creator is hard ...

US#2 As a **User** I want to **Share a graph I have created with others** so that **they can see what I have found** 

US#3 As a **User** I want to **Share a graph I have created with others** so that **they can see what I have found** 


Discussion
==========

US#2 is the intersting one right now (as we US#1 working in basic way).

And we could limit to simplest case where I just pick columns of dataset I want to share.

Later ....

(At least) Two things I want to record:

  * Current view on the dataset (e.g. query and the offset / limit values)
  * Current graph configuration 

Crudest approach: Represent all of that, serialize it and store it in a hash value or query string.

More complex: agree some formula for encoding into query string or url (i.e. agree variable names)

Our case:

  * Data Query: just take webstore or other query parameters and inline it directly? (but how do we know which are the parameters meant for this query)
  * Graph Config: ?xcol=val&ycols=...||...||... or ?graph-xcol=

Conclusion: ultimately any decent query string setup involves a serialization of some data structure which may as well be JSON. The main point of the serialization is that it is easier to parse and edit as a human. However, it introduces yet another syntax and will likely get quite complex as underlying config becomes more complex.
