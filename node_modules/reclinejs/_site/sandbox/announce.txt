[Cut?] Recline been under development for over 6 months -- and in production use on the DataHub since the start of the year -- and we feel it has now reached the stage suitable for public consumption by others!

## What Is It?

Recline is two things:

* Powerful data explorer built in pure javascript and html
* A library of data components - grid, graphing and data connectors

In both cases our primary aim has been to *re-use* other open-source components wherever possible, weaving those components together into a coherent whole and making them easy to use.

The full Explorer can be used as an app in itself either online at http://reclinejs.com/explorer/ or offline (just download and use). Alternatively it can be easily embedded into your own site or app -- for example we embed Recline in CKAN and the DataHub to provide our data viewer and visualization tool.

[repetition?] Recline builds on the powerful but lightweight Backbone framework making it extremely easy to extend and adapt and the library's modular design mean means you only have to take what you need.

Main features:

* View (and edit) your data in a clean grid / table interface
* Built in visualizations including graphs, maps and timelines
* Load data from multiple sources including online CSV and Excel, local CSV, Google Docs and the DataHub
* Bulk update/clean your data using an easy scripting UI
* Easily extensible with new Backends so you can connect to your database or storage layer
* Open-source, pure javascript and designed for integration -- so it is easy to embed in other sites and applications
* Built on the simple but powerful <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">Backbone</a> giving a clean and robust design which is easy to extend
* Properly designed model with clean separation of data and presentation
* Componentized design means you use only what you need

## Who's Behind It

Recline has been developed by Rufus Pollock and Max Ogden with substantial contributions from the [CKAN team](http://ckan.org/) including Adria Mercader and Aron Carroll. 

## History

Max Ogden was developing Recline as the frontend data browser and editor for
his <a href="http://datacouch.com/">http://datacouch.com/</a> project.
Meanwhile, Rufus Pollock and the <a href="http://ckan.org/">CKAN team</a> at
the <a href="http://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> had been working
on a <a href="http://github.com/okfn/dataexplorer">Data Explorer</a> for use in
<a href="http://thedatahub.org">the DataHub</a> and <a
href="http://ckan.org/">CKAN software</a>.
        
When they met up, they realized that they were pretty much working on the same
thing and so decided to join forces to produce the new Recline Data Explorer.

The new project originally forked off Max's original recline codebase. It then
combined some portions of the <a
href="http://github.com/okfn/dataexplorer">original Data Explorer</a> and had a
complete rewrite from the ground up using Backbone.
