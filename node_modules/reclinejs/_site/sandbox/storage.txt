We need to store stuff.

* State of the app at the present
* Data ...
* Scripts

Q: Why?

* State: So I can come back to it and so i can share with others.
** Want to share with others => stable url to share with others
* Data: so it is persisted somewhere
* Scripts: so I can re-run them

## What's wrong with the DataHub

* No way to search Resources -- which are objects to which data is actually attached.
* Loads of datasets with no resources or unusable resources
* No straightforward way to save ...
** Have to create a dataset and then a resource ...

## Answers

Use local storage by default

Then we abuse the DataHub (??) or a simple ElasticSearch service ...

Aside: Sharable admin URL approach: secret ID = HMAC(API KEY, Entity ID)
